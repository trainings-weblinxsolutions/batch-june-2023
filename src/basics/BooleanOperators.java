 //Try ||, &=,|= operators 
 // see what the output is, try to read why we are getting this
 

// Play around with other operators as well, take a look at the file JavaTheory_2 (Present here https://github.com/trainings-weblinxsolutions/batch-june-2023/tree/master/src/resources/documents) -> Boolean Logical  Operators   Section
