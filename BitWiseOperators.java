 // Assignment - Please practice other bitwise operators 
 
 
 //Try left shit operator Eg: 20 << 1
 // see what the output is, try to read why we are getting this
 
 
//Try right shit operator Eg: 20 >> 1
// see what the output is, try to read why we are getting this

// Play around with other operators as well, take a look at the file JavaTheory_2 (Present here https://github.com/trainings-weblinxsolutions/batch-june-2023/tree/master/src/resources/documents) -> BitWise Operators  Section
